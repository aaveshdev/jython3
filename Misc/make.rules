# Generic Makefile rules for building JPython.  Assumes GNU make.
# Configure your build of JPython by modifying macros in this file.

# You will need to get Sun's JavaCC (Java Compiler Compiler) to build
# the JPython parser.  JavaCC can be downloaded from
# http://www.sun.com/suntest/products/JavaCC/index.html
# I currently use JavaCC 0.7.1 to build JPython, our grammar files are
# incompatible with any newer version of JavaCC.  While this will be
# fixed in some future version, for now don't rebuild the .java files
# in org/python/parser.

# Uncomment these 3 lines to use the Jikes compiler.  Jikes is a Java
# compiler available from IBM's alphaWorks.  It is much faster than
# Sun's javac.  You'll need at least Jikes 0.50.  I've tested up to
# Jikes 1.02, which seems to work well.  You may need to change
# BOOTSTRAPCLASSES to point to your standard Java classes.  Jikes
# requires you to supply your own standard classes; the one described
# below comes from Sun's production JDK 1.2 for Solaris.

# Get Jikes from http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/formula/Jikes
