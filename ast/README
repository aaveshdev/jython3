Files in this project:
Python.asdl - zephyr file taken directly from CPython release25-maint
asdl.py - base asdl program copied from CPython release25-maint
asdl_java.py - copied from CPython sandbox for reference
asdl_anltr.py - adapted from asdl_java.py to produce antlr style ast classes
astlip.py - adapted from Jim Baker's ast -> s-expression utility
            it now runs itself and jastlib.py and diffs the results
            run with -h for more options
build.xml - ant file for building the project
crawl - runs only the grammar on a file (note add any second param to get a
        print of the tree) - empty output means a successful walk.
fails - a runner for release25 files that fail
globwalk.py - a recursive globber used by astlib.py
jastlib.py - adapted from astlib.py to produce a reasonable s-expression
             from jython parsing with antlr
regr - a runner for release25 files that should succeed
run - runs grammar and walker on a file (note add any second param to get a
      print of the trees) - empty output means a successful walk.
spark.py - copied from CPython -- used by asdl

known bugs:
* The following files in release25 completely blow up astlib.py:
      Lib/test/test_pep263.py
      Lib/test/bad_coding.py
      Lib/test/bad_coding2.py
      Lib/test/badsyntax_nocaret.py
so I generally delete these files before running astlib.py on the whole 
release25 Lib.
