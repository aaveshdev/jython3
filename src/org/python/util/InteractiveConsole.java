 * a console itself. The primary capability is the {@link #interact()} method, which repeatedly
 * calls {@link #raw_input(PyObject)}, and hence {@link __builtin__#raw_input(PyObject)}, in order
 * to get lines, and {@link #push(String)} them into the interpreter. The built-in
 * <code>raw_input()</code> method prompts on <code>sys.stdout</code> and reads from
 * <code>sys.stdin</code>, the standard console. These may be redirected using
 * {@link #setOut(java.io.OutputStream)} and {@link #setIn(java.io.InputStream)}, as may also
 * <code>sys.stderr</code>.
